# NLP Embeddings

Problem Scenario: Introduction to NLP and Word Embeddings

In this problem scenario, you will dive into the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and explore the concept of word embeddings. Your objective is to understand the key concepts and techniques used in NLP and apply word embeddings to capture semantic representations of words in a given corpus.

NLP Overview:
You will begin by familiarizing yourself with the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP techniques enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. You will learn about various NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation, among others.

Word Embeddings:
Next, you will delve into the concept of word embeddings. Word embeddings are dense vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and relationships between words in a text corpus. You will learn about popular word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe, which leverage neural network architectures to generate distributed representations of words. These embeddings allow for mathematical operations on words and enable algorithms to understand semantic similarities and analogies.

Problem Task:
Your task is to apply word embeddings to a given corpus of text. You will use pre-trained word embedding models like Word2Vec or GloVe to generate word vectors for the words in the corpus. By doing so, you will be able to capture the semantic meaning and contextual information of each word. You can then utilize these word embeddings to perform various NLP tasks such as word similarity analysis, document classification, or sentiment analysis.

Through this problem scenario, you will gain a foundational understanding of NLP and explore the power of word embeddings in capturing semantic representations of words. By applying these techniques to real-world text data, you will be able to uncover valuable insights and develop more advanced NLP applications in the future.

# BERT from Scratch

Problem Scenario: 

In this assignment, you are tasked with developing your own minimalist version of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. BERT is a state-of-the-art language model that utilizes transformer-based architectures for various natural language processing tasks.

Your objective is to implement some key components of the BERT model to gain a deeper understanding of its architecture. You will focus on developing the necessary modules and functionalities required for sentence classification using BERT.

The assignment will involve performing sentence classification on two datasets: the sst dataset and the cfimdb dataset. These datasets contain labeled sentences, and your goal is to train your BERT model to classify the sentences into appropriate categories based on their semantic meanings.

Important Details and Notes:

1) Ensure that you follow the provided setup.sh script to set up the environment and install the required dependencies. It is crucial to work within the designated environment for consistency.
2) Refer to the structure.md document for a detailed description of the code structure, including the specific components you need to implement.
3) You are only allowed to use the torch library for this assignment. Other external libraries, such as transformers, are not permitted.
4) The code you submit should be reproducible using the provided commands. 

Task:

Your task is to carefully implement the necessary components of the BERT model, perform sentence classification on the sst and cfimdb datasets, and aim for the best possible performance. Through this assignment, you will gain practical experience in building and training a BERT-based model for sentence classification tasks.

# Sentence Classification

Problem Scenario: 

In this problem scenario, you are tasked with developing a sentence classification model using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. Your objective is to collect and annotate a dataset suitable for sentence classification, assess the agreement among annotators using the Kappa coefficient, and train a BERT-based model for accurate classification.

Data Collection:
You will begin by collecting a dataset of sentences that are relevant to your specific task or domain. The dataset should contain a sufficient number of sentences to ensure representative coverage of the classification categories you aim to predict.

Annotations:
Once you have collected the dataset, you need to annotate each sentence with the appropriate class or label. This step involves assigning a predefined class or label to each sentence based on its intended meaning or category. It is essential to ensure consistency and accuracy in the annotation process.

Raw Agreement / Kappa Coefficient:
To evaluate the agreement among annotators, you will calculate the raw agreement or use statistical measures such as the Kappa coefficient. The Kappa coefficient measures the agreement between multiple annotators, taking into account the possibility of agreement by chance. This assessment helps ensure the reliability and consistency of the annotations.

BERT Model and Multi-Lingual BERT:
After obtaining the annotated dataset and assessing the agreement, you will proceed to train a sentence classification model using the BERT architecture. BERT is a powerful language model that captures contextual information and can achieve high accuracy in various natural language processing tasks. Additionally, you may explore using Multi-Lingual BERT, which is specifically designed to handle multilingual text data, enabling the classification of sentences in different languages.

Task:
Your task is to collect a dataset for sentence classification, annotate the dataset with appropriate labels, assess the agreement among annotators using the Kappa coefficient or raw agreement, and train a BERT or Multi-Lingual BERT model for accurate sentence classification. By completing these steps, you aim to develop a robust model capable of classifying sentences accurately, taking into account the contextual information and potential language diversity in the data.
